## Sorting algorithm

- Sorting as the name suggest, its a way of making sure that a given elements are on the right order
- The same with sorting algorithm, its an algorithm that putsa elements of a list into an order

## Important of sorting

- Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms such as:
	- Search
	- merge

A Sorting algorithm must satisy two condition:

- The output is in monotonic order (each element is no smaller/larger than the previous element, according to the required order).
- The output is a permutation (a reordering, yet retaining all of the original elements) of the input.
